                            <p>I've been used to build code since when I can't remember more.</p>
                            <p>Write clean, fast and smart code completes me, not only because it gives me money, but mainly because it challenges and allows me to think differently.</p>
                            <p>I also like to help and lead people to get a true purpose where I am working.</p>
                            <p>I worked in five companies, developing or leading small teams and what I can say about myself is I am ready to face many different environments and projects. As a developer, I have worked with PHP, C#, .NET, Angular, Ionic, MySQL, SQL SERVER, PostgreSQL, jQuery, Bootstrap and many others technologies. I also have good knowledge in MVC and DDD patterns.</p>
                            <p>I won the first Hackathon of the Tribunais de Contas do Brasil developing an app in Ionic and Firebase and I already lectured at Universidade Potiguar (UnP), during the scientific congress, about these technologies.</p>
