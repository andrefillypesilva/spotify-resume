As a developer, I have worked with PHP, C#, .NET, Angular, Ionic, MySQL, SQL SERVER, PostgreSQL, jQuery, Bootstrap and many others technologies. I also have good knowledge in MVC and DDD patterns.</p><p>I won the first Hackathon of the Tribunais de Contas do Brasil developing an app in Ionic and Firebase and I already lectured at Universidade Potiguar (UnP), during the scientific congress, about these technologies.</p>"
